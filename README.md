## Forex Prediction Model

Implementation of a Random forest algorithm model to predict stock prices for the S&P 500 index.

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and preprocessed the data using **yfinance** library and data cleaning techniques. 
- Created a target column to train and study trends using the model
2. Model Training
- Developed a Random Forrest Regressor model with key parameters for increased accuracy on predictions
- Trained the model using predefined training set and evaluted for precision, accuracy, and MSE
3. Backtesting
- Developed a backtesting function to evaluate model performance using historical data
- Gathered data from backtesting process for evaluation using the earlier mentioned metrics
4. Model Improvement
- Changed model parameters to improve the performace of the model
- Created new set of predictor variables to increase reliability and accuracy
5. Reporting 
- Reported on the performance of the model and relevance of each step to imporve the model
